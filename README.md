# Wine-price-prediction
This ML project is designed to accurately predict the quality, and therefore, the price of wine in the Bordeaux region of France. It is widely known that older wines typically taste better and consequently fetch a higher price. Wine buyers profit from knowing in advance which wines will taste better in the future.

I used a multi-variable linear regression in RStudio with price as my dependent variable (outcome variable) and independent variables of weather and age to predict wine prices. I created a total of five ML models and used a test dataset from 1979 - 1980 to verify that my model was accurate.

An analysis of the test data and the predictTest concludes that model4 is the closest prediction of wine prices of 6.95 for 1979 and 6.5 for 1980.

One of my first steps is to become more familar with the data. My initial analysis finds that there are seven varibles and 25 observations. AGST = Average Growing Season Temperature, Age = the age of the wine, FrancePop = population of France.
